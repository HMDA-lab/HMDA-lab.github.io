  "content"  : "Woncheol Jang is a professor in the Department of Statistics and has a joint appointment at Brain and Cognitive Science at Seoul National University. He is currently serving on the editorial boards of Journal of Korean Statistical Society, JASA/TAS Review and Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems. He received his BS in Computer Science and Statistics and MS in Statistics both from Seoul National University in 1991 and 1993, respectively. After a brief stint at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, he went to Carnegie Mellon University to become a Bayesian. Ironically, he didn’t do any Bayesian stuff for his thesis but landed back to the Bayesian world, ISDS, at Duke. After spending eight years at Duke and University of Georgia, he joined the Department of Statistics at Seoul National University in 2012. To him, statistics is a tool for solving scientific problems, and he feels lucky to choose statistics as his professional area, so he still can pursue all his childhood dreams, astronomer, geneticist, and baseball analyst. On the theoretical side, he is interested in the development of a framework for infinite-dimensional data common in many scientific areas. On the application side, his collaborations encompass such topics as astronomy, computer science, epidemiology, neuroscience, and politics.\n\nEmail\n wcjang@snu.ac.kr\n\nOffice \nRoom 323, Building #25 \nDepartment of Statistics \nSeoul National University \n1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu \nSeoul, Korea 08826 \nPhone : +82-2-880-8164\n\n"

His undergraduate dissertation research investigated the interest rate, bond price and their models. He is interested in multiple testing. From 2019, he conducted a research about whether I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer patient has side effect or not. It is a co-research with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. He researched about using propensity score for non-randomized clinical trial.\n\nEmail\nyangha08@snu.ac.kr\n"
